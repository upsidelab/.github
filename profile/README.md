We contribute to the tools we rely on to build and run innovative technology solutions supporting our businesses' growth, while also maintaining our own open source projects :octocat:

- [Spree Commerce](https://github.com/spree/spree) - An open-source multi-language/multi-currency/multi-store eCommerce platform
- [Spree CLI](https://github.com/upsidelab/spree_cli_internal) - A command line tool for bootstraping Spree with modern storefront integrations
- [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/spree) - An integration for [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) commerce built on top of [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/)

### We're all things Spree

We've joined the Spree Commerce core team as the main steward. We take the responsibility of driving the roadmap and development of the open source platform.

**Our goal?** Improve the developer experience and make Spree easier to cater for modern business needs while keeping **execution of the roadmap** 🎯 and **the community** 🧡 in mind.

<!-- TODO: Stay updated on our mission to improve the Spree platform with [Spree Roadmap]() ⚡️ -->
